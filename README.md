a dashboard for small displays.
works on RPI, try to avoid OLED displays(they're succeptible to burn-in)
made in node.js. includes many widgets to mimic ipados like weather, stocks, school schedule, time, news, and date and has a unsplash background.

The dashboard uses [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/), [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/), [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/), [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) and my school schedule's API. also uses some libraries for date and time. If you want to run it yourself, you'll need to get your own API keys. The ones I'm using are free though.

AI used lightly as an assistant.
